              The only personal information we collect is your email address,
              and only if you choose to purchase a subscription. That&apos;s it.
              We need this solely to manage your account and provide the service
              you&apos;ve paid for.

            <p className="">
              We believe financial information should be accessible to everyone,
              not locked away behind paywalls or scattered across dozens of
              different sources. While we know that complex financial situations
              often benefit from professional guidance tailored to your specific
              circumstances, the basic information and tools to understand your
              options should always be free and easy to find.

          <div className="mt-5">
            <p className="">
              Our goal is to create one comprehensive place where you can ask
              questions and get clear answers about financial topicsâ€”without the
              runaround, without the data harvesting, and without the fees that
              often put crucial information out of reach.

              Your privacy matters. Your data is yours. We&apos;re here to
              provide financial information, not to become another company
              profiting from your personal details.
